### KindleForge

**Q: The KindleForge scriptlet doesn't appear!**

A: Ensure you have copied `KindleForge.sh` into your documents folder. If this is true, and the scriptlet still isn't showing, then reinstall the latest hotfix using the steps above.

**Q: When I click on the scriptlet, it says "Application Error!"**

A: Chances are, you've installed KindleForge incorrectly. **BOTH the folder AND scriptlet MUST be in the `documents` folder on your kindle!** 

**Q: I keep getting core dumps & crashlogs generated when using KindleForge/Scriptlets!**

A: You must be on the latest hotfix, 2.3.1+. Use the steps mentioned above to reinstall hotfix

**Q: No apps load and I'm getting "Unknown ABI!"**

A: This issue has been known to be resolved by pressing 'Update KForge' which ensures a proper reinstallation, though. Also reboot & reload!
